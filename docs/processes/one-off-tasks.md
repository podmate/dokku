# One-off Tasks

```
run [-e|--env KEY=VALUE] [--no-tty] <app> <cmd>              # Run a command in a new container using the current app image
run:detached [-e|-env KEY=VALUE] [--no-tty] <app> <cmd>      # Run a command in a new detached container using the current app image
run:list [<app>]                                             # List all run containers for an app
run:logs <app|--container CONTAINER> [-h] [-t] [-n num] [-q] # Display recent log output for run containers
```

Sometimes it is necessary to run a one-off command under an app. Dokku makes it easy to run a fresh container via the `run` command.

## Usage

### Running a one-off command

The `run` command can be used to run a one-off process for a specific command. This will start a new container and run the desired command within that container.  The container image will be the same container image as was used to start the currently deployed app.

> New as of 0.25.0, this container will be removed after the process exits.

```shell
# runs `ls -lah` in the `/app` directory of the app `node-js-app`
dokku run node-js-app ls -lah

# optionally, run can be passed custom environment variables
dokku run --env "NODE_ENV=development" --env "PATH=/custom/path" node-js-app npm run mytask
```

One off containers are removed at the end of process execution.

#### Running Procfile commands

The `run` command can also be used to run a command defined in the app `Procfile`:

```
console: bundle exec racksh
```

```shell
# runs `bundle exec racksh` in the `/app` directory of the app `my-app`
dokku run my-app console
```

#### Specifying container labels

Containers may have specific labels attached. In order to avoid issues with dokku internals, do not use any labels beginning with either `com.dokku` or `org.label-schema`.

```shell
dokku --label=com.example.test-label=value run node-js-app ls -lah
```

#### Disabling TTY

> New as of 0.25.0

One-off containers default to interactive mode where possible. To disable this behavior, specify the `--no-tty` flag:

```shell
dokku run --no-tty node-js-app ls -lah
```

### Running a detached container

> New as of 0.25.0

Finally, a container can be run in "detached" mode via the `run:detached` Dokku command. Running a process in detached mode will immediately return a `CONTAINER_ID`. Detached containers are run without a tty and are also removed at the end of process execution.

```shell
dokku run:detached node-js-app ls -lah
# returns the ID of the new container
```

### Displaying one-off container logs

You can easily get logs of all one-off containers for an app using the `logs` command:

```shell
dokku run:logs node-js-app
```

Logs are pulled via integration with the scheduler for the specified application via "live tailing". As such, logs from previously running deployments are usually not available. Users that desire to see logs from previous deployments for debugging purposes should persist those logs to external services. Please see Dokku's [vector integration](/docs/deployment/logs.md#vector-logging-shipping) for more information on how to persist logs across deployments to ship logs to another service or a third-party platform.

#### Behavioral modifiers

Dokku also supports certain command-line arguments that augment the `run:log` command's behavior.

```
--container NAME     # the name of a specific container to show logs for
-n, --num NUM        # the number of lines to display
-t, --tail           # continually stream logs
-q, --quiet          # display raw logs without colors, time and names
```

You can use these modifiers as follows:

```shell
dokku run:logs -t --container node-js-app.run.1234
```

The above command will show logs continually from the `node-js-app.run.1234` one-off run process.

### Listing one-off containers

> New as of 0.25.0

One-off containers for a given app can be listed via the `run:list` command:

```shell
dokku run:list node-js-app
```

```
=====> node-js-app run containers
NAMES                   COMMAND            CREATED
node-js-app.run.28689   "/exec sleep 15"   2 seconds ago
```

> The `COMMAND` displayed will be what Docker executes and may not exactly match the command specified by a `dokku run` command.
